### How do I manage my cookies preferences?
There are a number of ways you can manually manage cookies on your computer/device. If you access the Internet from more than one computer/device, it is important to ensure each browser is configured to suit your cookie preferences. If you wish to block all cookies all the time you can set your browser to do this.
Please note that blocking cookies may result in some parts of our site not working as efficiently as they might otherwise do or at all. This may affect your browsing experience.

### Security
